Intel Unnati Vehicle Cut-In
Overview
This project aims to develop a model to predict vehicle cut-in behavior using various machine learning techniques. The model leverages the IDD (Indian Driving Dataset) to identify and analyze instances where vehicles cut into lanes abruptly, which is critical for enhancing the safety features of autonomous driving systems.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Feature extraction and engineering
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
Model evaluation and validation
Visualization of results
Dataset
We use the IDD (Indian Driving Dataset) for this project. The dataset contains annotated images and data related to driving scenarios in India, providing a rich source of information for training and testing our model.
